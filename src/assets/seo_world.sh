Challenging New Discoveries Could Slow China’s Oil Production Growth \
China could see its oil production growth taper off in the coming years as the recent new discoveries could prove challenging to develop while output at mature fields declines, according to analysts and forecasters.    Since 2019, China has boosted its crude oil production every year, by around 2% per year, as the state-owned oil giants have endorsed the official government policy to ramp up exploration and production to make China – the world’s top crude oil importer – less dependent on imports. In the first nine months…\

Putin Orders Asset Seizures From Austrian and German Energy Giants\
Western sanctions on the Russian oil and gas sector and entities have not yet been as functional as expected by most. Still, Moscow’s energy stranglehold on Europe’s energy sectors has been broken by Western actions. Until now, Russian President Vladimir Putin has not been hitting back with a vengeance, but that looks like it's about to change. Putin has ordered the seizure of Austria’s OMV and Germany’s Wintershall DEA assets in Russia. The main aim is clearly to hit back at the West while also cementing control of the…\

Will the COP28 Consensus Keep Fossil Fuels in the Ground?\
The consensus agreement reached in Dubai last week evoked a mixture of triumph and angst. In the world’s warmest year on record, the world’s nations for the first time agreed to ‘transition away’ from fossil fuels. But the path to transition looks to be a long one.

It also saw, in the same final session,…\
The Big Problem With Electrifying Everything\
The UN-sponsored COP28 climate conference has issued a number of proposals for reducing CO2 emissions, some criticized as too weak, others as too radical. But looking at energy data what struck us is the enormity of that task of reducing carbon emissions and how little has actually changed over the past fifty years with respect to fossil fuel usage (the data we’re looking at begins in 1965), even though the first warnings about fossil fuel emissions date to Lyndon Johnson’s administration in the 1960s. Starting in 1965, fossil fuel…\

Sodium-Ion: A Game-Changer in the Global Battery Market\
Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have shown that the sodium-ion battery has an equivalent climate impact as their lithium-ion competitors – without the risk of running out of raw materials. The transition to a society without fossil fuels means that the need for batteries is increasing at a rapid pace. At the same time, the increase will mean a shortage of the metals lithium and cobalt, which are key components in the most common battery types. One option is a sodium-ion battery, where table salt and biomass from…\
